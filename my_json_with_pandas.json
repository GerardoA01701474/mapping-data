It is a complex wine with austerity, virility and elegant structure. ","183":"Messorio, which was born in 1994, is Le Macchiole's personal interpretation of one of the grape varieties most commonly grown in the Bolgheri area: Merlot. The name Messorio refers to the ancient Tuscan practice of wheat harvesting, the most important time of the year in the countryside; now, to Le Macchiole, it is all about grape harvesting. A generous grape variety, perfect for the typical Bolgherese wine blends, but tricky and difficult when made into a single varietal wine.

Today Paleo Rosso is a symbol of Bolgheri despite its distinct individualism and originality within the region; it is one of the most famous Italian Cabernet Franc wines in the world.

The finish is long and marked by sweet fruit and cocoa flavors.","550":"#68","556":"Crafted to express the serious side of Chenin Blanc, we age this elegant and sophisticated winefor three years in concrete, barrel and bottle prior to release.

On the palate, thewine is dense, sweet, and broodingly dark. Simply perfectfine-grained tannins melded with laser-focused acidity deliverimpressive length that lingers on the palate.","579":"The 1998 vintage was a winemakers dream in the Walla Walla Valley. The year was very warm with perfect conditions from bloom to harvest. Yields were naturally low and resulted in wines of incredible intensity, color, and fruit. Our 1998 Cabernet Sauvignon is a very dark wine with an incredible nose consisting of aromatic cedar, anise, black cherry, and balsam. This is a very distinctive wine with a rich, heavy mouthfeel. This weighty palate impression is backed by high-quality, fine grained tannins.","580":"Intense Dark color saturated to the rim. Initial aromas of vanilla, spice, and tobacco evolve in the glass to sweet cassis, currants and dark fruits. Seamless tannins carry the wonderful viscous finish across the palate.

Beautifully complex, sultry nose of dark fruits, including plum and cassis with dried herbs \u2014predominantly rosemary and sage \u2014 with complementary notes of earth and tar. The wine has a wonderfully voluptuous texture on the palette and slowly reveals a masculine structure and excellent acidity on its long finish. A simply classic Leonetti Cabernet, reminiscent of the delicious 2008 vintage. 2012 was an exquisitely warm growing season and all of our Cabernet vineyards performed brilliantly. ","586":"Dark and brooding, the 2013 Leonetti Cabernet Sauvignonhas a beautiful nose of blackberries, blue fruits, spices, and black tea, perfectly framed by a light touch of toasted French oak.

Intricate nose of licorice, lavender, dried herb, cold black coffee mixed with caramel, black fruits, and elderberry. Incredible purity of fruit. Massive, but plush, with a core of mouthwatering acidity and a polished finish. ","594":"Perhaps as much as any other varietal, Merlot reflects the vintage from which it is produced, and 1998 is sure to go down as one of the finest vintages in the history of Washington wine. Leonetti's \u201998 Merlot Columbia Valley possesses an inky dark purple color. The nose is that of jammy ripe black and red dried fruits, chocolate, and oak-influenced vanillan. The mouthfeel is incredibly rich, soft, and fleshy, buttressed by long, fine-grained tannins. This is a compelling, Hedonistic wine with solid aging potential.","595":"It is a very dark wine with a brooding nose of dust, mint, bay leaf, and black fruits. The wine has signature Leonetti integrated oak, and harmonious, high toned fruit. This wine is rich, with excellent acid balance typical of the vintage, and ends with a long finish.","597":"The wine jumps from the glass with a brilliant, high-toned fruit nose of flowers, freshly cut fruit, and cherry liqueur backed with subtle, integrated spicy oak. This classic Leonetti Merlot presents soft but dense sweet fruit on the pallet as fully ripe, mellow tannins disappear into a long, seamless finish.","599":"\"The 2005 Merlot contains 8% Cabernet Sauvignon and 7% Petit Verdot. It spent 14 months in French and American oak and was bottled unfiltered. Purple-colored, it has a splendid bouquet of pain grille, spice box, cassis, and black currants. This is followed by a plush wine with layered flavors, superb balance, and terrific length. This outstanding Merlot can be enjoyed now but merits 4-6 years of further cellaring. It should provide pleasure through 2030.\"","602":"This bright, aromatic, vivid wine opens with a bowlful of berries and cherries. There is plenty of acid under the ripe fruit, which takes center stage at the moment. The significant addition of Carmen\u00e8re (from the Seven Hills vineyard) adds black pepper to the engaging mix of flavors. Despite its youth, the flavors persist for a remarkably long finish,","603":"The wine is dark and saturated. In the glass, the wine explodes with an ethereal, complex nose of cinnamon, plum, pomegranate, clove, and a  hint of spring pine forest. On the palate, the wine has delicious fresh ripe fruit, reminiscent of berry pie filling. Incredible richness but with a stunning levity that lifts.","604":"Dense, dark, and lush but with amazing focus and levity. Loaded with dark blue and black fruits. Gorgeous high tone aromatics are reminiscent of brambleberry reduction compote. Long and plush on the palate, but with a fine grained tannin structure and brilliant acidity from the epic 2010 vintage. This may be the finest Merlot in Leonetti's history. I am completely enamored by the complexity of this wine. The cool vintage gives such restraint to the opulence of the fruit. This wine will drink well upon release but age for many years to come. Made with 100% Merlot.","605":"As pure and linear an expression of Walla Walla Merlot thatyou might imagine. Simply gorgeous red and black fruits,especially blueberries, raspberries, and hints of dried apricot.The mouth feel is so wonderfully plush, delicious, andexpansive. This wine just makes me smile with pleasure andis everything I love about Walla Walla Merlot. The additionof 8% Cabernet Franc from old vines at the Leonetti Estatecontributes lovely violet aromatics and glycerin to the palate.","606":"This 100% Merlot pours inky into the glass. The nose is deep and intricate with top note florals lifting it higher as it opens. Tightly focused, the wine saturates the palate with dense blue and black fruits that linger endlessly. An immensely pleasurable wine, it possesses all the attributes that make Walla Walla one of the world\u2019s premier places to grow Merlot. ","608":"2016 will be remembered as a classic vintage for Merlot. Thiswine has a delicious, creamy nose with jammy black fruits andmixed florals. It is incredibly broad on the palate\u2013a distinctivecharacteristic of Washington Merlot. The finish is spicy, sweet,lively, and lengthy. ","611":"A wine with great depth of color, our '98 Reserve has a nose of rich black fruits, creme brulee, spice, and cream, while maintaining varietal purity. The palate is ultra-rich and mouth-filling, with flavors of black fruits and integrated wood spice. The incredibly long finish is backed by delicious fine-grained, soft tannins, and integrated toasty oak. This wine will likely be remembered as one of the finest Leonetti's produced to date. ","613":"Having a beautiful saturated color, the wine's nose is enchanting ith a complex potpourri of rich, ripe sweet black fruits, plum, and spicebox with hints of beautiful herbs de Provence. The palate of the wine is structured with fine-grained smooth tannins and notes of mineral, creme cassis, and finishes very long with monumental purity. ","614":"2000 Reserve reveals beautifully deep color and a bright, high tone nose of ripe fruits, cedar, and spicy oak-influenced vanillin. This is a tightly wound wine with long aging potential that will be immediately pleasing as well.  ","615":"The best barrels from an entire vintage earn the right to become part of the Leonetti Reserve blend, which is simply our finest effort every year we produce it. This year all three of our estate vineyards had shining stars that contributed to the blend. For the first time, Malbec from Loess Vineyard makes an appearance. Thsi year's Reserve is once again just monumental. While still tight today (as you'd expect at this young age), the nose has a beautiful medley of plums and black fruits, blackberry puree, very ripe bloddy bing cherries, dried rose petals and a whiff of smoke and cedar. While being very big, dense and long in the finish, the palate impression is perfectly balanced and plush, with an incredible glycerin mouthfeel. I'm terrifically proud of this wine, and confident you will agree it stands comfortably amongst the finest Bordeaux-varietal red wines in the world. ","616":"Dark, saturated and gorgeous. Intoxicating nose of fresh flowers, dark red fruit and a glorious citrus note - which Leonetti are rarely able to capture in their wines. There is also a tiny sprinkling of cedar shavings, Creme de cassis, and crushed blackcurrant. Unbelievably vibrant and focused. The palate is plush and long with a core of sweetness. Respecting the coolness of the vintage, the acidity is deliciously bright and the tannin low. ","617":"Divinely complex with notes of sweet fresh and dried flowers, balsam, creme brulee, and vanilla. Pure ripe fruit without being cloying. Background notes of a freshly cut white fir awaiting Christmas lights. Delicious, incredible length, with a string of perfect acidity coursing throughout and supporting the intense fruit with levity and freshness.  ","618":"Impenetrably dark. An explosive nose of coffee, red and black fruits, Russian sage, and garden herbs. Lesser notes follow of cr\u00e8me cassis, currant, and black olive.

It's quite slick on the palate, with good texture from well-integrated tannins. The fruit is dark and brooding - black cherry and wild blackberry - with a hint of rose, smoke and cedar. ","622":"Cabernet Sauvignon 69%, Petit Verdot 11%, Merlot 11%, Cabernet Franc 9%.","625":"The opening nose of this wine is textbook Sangiovese. Strawberries and strawberry preserves dominate the fruit profile backed up by some beautiful floral notes and aromatics you would expect of an old-world Brunello or Chianti such as saddle leather and earth. The palate reveals the wine's youth as it is a big, tannic youngster on the first taste. This gives way to impressive length, some chalky oak, with a fantastic cutting acidity, focus and a burst of fruit that makes this wine's profile just explode wtih food. We're very proud to have this wine in the Leonetti stable, as it is so entirely different from our Bordeaux variety wines and yet so entirely attractive in those differences. We are also tremendously happy with our decision to add an extra 6 months of bottle age, further improving our Sangiovese program, already critically noted as the finest in the U.S., if not the world! ","630":"Very dark color that any Brunello from the finest of vintages would envy. The nose bursts with bright, freshly macerated ripe strawberries and Bing cherries. There is a sense of stoney minerality that you'll positively love. On the palate, reserved sweet fruit. Ripe and plentiful \"Brunello\" style tannin. Possessing beautiful precision and focus, this Sangiovese epitomizes leanness and power. A paradox in a glass! Being a \"dream vintage\", the 2010 Sangiovese may be Leonetti's finest to date and will age for decades if you can keep your hands off it. ","632":"Beautiful deep garnet color. The nose displays driving, darkred Bing cherries. This wine tastes like a liquid expression of that flavor. A unique contributing factor to this wine blend is theaddition of 8% of the varietal Aglianico. A first for WallaWalla Valley, we planted this ancient grape of southernItaly in our Serra Pedace Vineyard. We tried a splash of thisvarietal in the blend and found it fit like a glove, addingstructure and a firm core of austere fruit.","633":"Dazzling, dark ruby color. An alluring nose and palate of wet stones, crushed cherries, and ripe strawberries, with lesser notes of sawdust, cr\u00e8me vanilla, elderberries, and roses. The palate is alive with a brilliance and levity that is incredibly refreshing. The tannins are fine-grained with perfect balance and a delightfully satisfying finish.","639":"This wine has a beautiful purple and dense red color. The nose has fresh aromas of violet, red fruit and minerality with a hint of spices (Sichuan pepper). This wine is balanced between freshness and density in the mouth. The tannins are velvety. The palate is on aromas of liquorice and fruit with notes of violets. A nice match between balance and structure.","645":"This Single Vineyard wine is made from a single hectare on 'Asteries' (rock limestone) soil between Chateau Fonroque and Clos Fourtet. The vines survived the frost of 1956 and are up to eighty years old. 'Panacheed' in the old style (Merlot interspersed with Cabernet Franc to ensure easy blending in the days before pumps) they are cropped down to four bunches per vine to reflect the 'terroir' of the parcel.","646":"This Single Vineyard wine is made from a single hectare on 'Asteries' (rock limestone) soil between Chateau Fonroque and Clos Fourtet.

Intense taste with body and a wonderful texture, pure and profound. 100% Grenache.","652":"Intense and complex with the characteristic spiciness of syrah, and a lush, velvety finish.","655":"Valle d'Aosta Chardonnay is a lovely yellow. The nose is delicately floral with hints of banana and a bit of plum. On the palate, the wine is soft, fruity and mineral. This Chardonnay from this region is grown with excellent results, giving a wine with exuberant fruit flavor, combined with a pure expression of the \"terroir\" of the mountain. ","656":"The opening to the nose ranges from banana to candied citron, compositional grapes, accompanied by a spicy kick aptly presented by toasted oak. The entire nose-taste sensation transmits a dense texture to the palate, rich and candied, with great balance and elegance. A long finish slowly thins out with great pleasantness. Food accompaniments: great international cuisine, fondue and flan, fish, foie gras, fatty and blue cheeses.","659":"Les Forts de Latour receives meticulous care as the Grand Vin, both in the vineyeard and in the winery. The only notable difference, apart from the origin of the grapes, is the proportion of new barrels (50%) used in the maturing stage. The proportions of the grape varieties in the wine vary from one year to the next but there is always a higher proportion of Merlot (25-30%) compared to the Grand Vin.","663":"Blend: 61.5% Cabernet Sauvignon, 32.3% Merlot, 6.2% Petit Verdot","665":"This cuvee is a true homage to Philippe Cambie's passion for Grenache, Chateauneuf's most emblematic varietal.

The vineyard's elevation gives this dark and concentrated Cotes du Rhone its unique finesse and balance. ","672":"A powerful red color. On the nose,  soft spices with intense mouth. Excellent with bourguignon beef and lamb.","685":"From the Stagecoach Vineyard high on the eastern volcanic ridge above Napa, comes this rich and decadent, limited production Cabernet Sauvignon. The vivid red soils and rocky slopes come together to produce a wine with an aroma of sweet blackberry and cassis fruit that carries over into a superbly balanced and polished palate. ","686":"Beautifully ripe apple with a hint of caramel and oak spice, filled in with lemon chiffon notes. Caramelized apple and lemon vanilla cream flavors on the palate, with the texture gracefully balanced between a rich center and a crisp finish.","687":"This is, quite simply, a ferocious wine, unique in its uninhibited expression of the smells and flavors of the appellation.  No compromise is brooked here. The result is a wine that is controversial, too \"wild\" for many but, for others, one of the most elite wines.","688":"Les Journaries is a cuvee drawn from grapes harvested from old vines in the \"La Landonne\" lieu-dit.  This wine is more subtle, more elegant and \"quieter\" if you will than the Chavaroche Cote Rotie bottled by Levet.  At the same time, it is very much a Levet wine with a bouquet of violets, wild berries, a touch of animal and resinous-like tannins that speak of the inclusion of stems (a hallmark of the Levet tradition).  Les Journaries is approachable at an earlier stage and not only ages gracefully but almost requires a touch of patience. ","689":"The Leviathan wine is a red blend created afresh each vintage, sourced from some of the most coveted vineyards in California. Each year, a percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Merlot, and Cabernet Franc are blended together to produce a singular wine, showcasing all the best characteristics of the vintage.

The round supple tanninsin the 2005 Levy & McClellan are the result of thecool growing conditions and the extended ripening.
