Pure and elegant, the nose opens up towards blueberry and black raspberries as you swirl with hints of earl grey tea and baking spices. Rich and lush with a smooth entry on the palate that carries a lovely velvety texture of refined tannins wrapping finely around the sour cherry & iron fist minerality. Broader, yet with a long finish and a beautiful texture that provides a lasting impression. This highly complex wine with its silky open mouthfeel is a crowd pleaser."

The name Messorio refers to the ancient Tuscan practice of wheat harvesting, the most important time of the year in the countryside; now, to Le Macchiole, it is all about grape harvesting. A generous grape variety, perfect for the typical Bolgherese wine blends, but tricky and difficult when made into a single varietal wine. Currently considered to be one of Italy\u2019s most representative Merlot-based wines, Messorio is very complex and elegant and evolves beautifully in the bottle year by year."

The wine is massively concentrated, relatively high in alcohol by the standards here (15% plus on their component parts), and has a long, concentrated, chewy finish with high tannin and equally high extract. If there is one Chateauneuf du Pape that smells like an open-air Provencal spice, flower, and food market, it is Vieux Donjon. It is a classic, concentrated essence of Provence, all in an alcoholic beverage. This wine will need 4-5 years of cellaring when released and drink well for 15-20 years.\""

Leonetti's \u201998 Merlot Columbia Valley possesses an inky dark purple color. The nose is that of jammy ripe black and red dried fruits, chocolate, and oak-influenced vanillan. The mouthfeel is incredibly rich, soft, and fleshy, buttressed by long, fine-grained tannins. This is a compelling, Hedonistic wine with solid aging potential."

Sweet blue fruit and silky tannins with a dash of bacon fat create a round, deliciously fresh palate like steam-polished stones. "

        "notes": "Positioned between brothers, Alec and Mason, Ethan gets a walk-off home run in his first at-bat since the 2005 vintage. At short-stop Ethan sees lots of action and his wine covers all the bases with black raspberry, yellow peach and pancetta, plus a field of lavender, licorice and violets. Like a seasoned glove the wine has a supple pocket of boysenberry fruit generously laced with sweet oak and vanilla spice. He keeps his eye on the ball and the wine stays focused though a vibrant, youthful finish, making the out on every play."
